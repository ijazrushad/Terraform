After a few minutes, Terraform will finish and display the public_ip from the outputs.
You can then open that IP address in your web browser to see the "Hello from Terraform!" message.

âœ… Now you can paste this directly into a README or text document without formatting issues. Let me know if you want a sample Terraform .tf code block next!
